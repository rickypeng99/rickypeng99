### Hi there! I am Ricky Peng! ðŸ‘‹

Short bio - I'm a senior CS student at UIUC. I am interested in all kinds of application development and is particularly into Javascript (Welp sounds like just another frontend guy) :((

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [ygo_web](https://github.com/rickypeng99/yugioh_web). Basically it's a yugioh simulator written in Javascript! But don't expect to have your decks supported since I rewrote the core logics, which means that I will have to rewrite the card scripts as well :((
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love my life.
